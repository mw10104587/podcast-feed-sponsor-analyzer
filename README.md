# podcast-feed-sponsor-analyzer
A very naive tool to analyse the # of podcast episodes with sponsored content.
The main objective is to just download the feed information and export them into a csv file so that analyzers could do it manually. This piece of script tries to simplify that process by doing some keyword checks. 

### How to run this service
```
node index
```

### How to use? 
Please update the `startDate` and `endDate` in the index.js main function. 
Also please remember to update the output file name.
